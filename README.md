A simple repository for managing my dotfiles.

Right now divided into two branches:

- master: For my current dotfiles
- arch: For a complete new system build on Arch and Ansible

Eventually, the second is going to replace the first. The rest of the README contains information for the arch branch.


## Info

Most values of this table are left empty as its value will be decided later on.

## Installation

Ansible will be used to automatically set up the workspace.
